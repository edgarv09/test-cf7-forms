= Demo Installation Video =
[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOA-rGyv-js]

NOTE: The plugin uses [PDFTK](https://www.pdflabs.com/docs/pdftk-man-page/) to fill in PDF files. This means that your server has to have PHP shell commands enabled. If your server does not have `pdftk` installed, you can still use the plugin to generate 1 PDF file for 1 Formidable form.

If you [purchase](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/) the plugin using [our website](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/), you do not need to install `pdftk` or to enable shell commands on your server. You'll use our API according to the [Terms of Service](http://formidablepro2pdf.com/terms-of-service/). 

Enter the activation code on the plugin options page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements? =

[Formidable Forms plugin](http://www.formidablepro.com), make sure that your server can execute shell commands, and that `pdftk` is installed on your server.

If you purchase the plugin, no additional software installation is need.

PHP version should be at least 5.3.

= Does the plugin create PDF files? =

Not at this time. Currently the plugin populates pre-made PDF form fields with mapped data from Formidable Form and FormidablePro form fields.

Yes - standard user support is available through the support forum or purchase a key code for premium level support.
